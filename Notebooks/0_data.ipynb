    "In a influential paper David Card (1995) suggested if a potential student lives close to a college this reduces the cost of attendence and thereby raises the likelihood that the student will attend college. However, college proximity does not directly affect a student‚Äôs skills or abilities so should not have a direct effect on his or her market wage. These considerations suggest that college proximity can be used as an <em>instrument</em> for education in a wage regression. Card used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (NLSYM) for 1976. We drop observations for which `wage` is missing. The remaining sample has 3,010 observations.\n",
